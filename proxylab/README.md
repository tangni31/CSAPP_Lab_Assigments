# Proxy Lab
---
This is a simple HTTP proxy that caches web objects. The proxy can accept incoming connections, read and parse requests, 
forward requests to web servers, read the serversâ€™ responses, and forward those responses to the corresponding clients 
and it can deal with multiple concurrent connections. It caches web objects using a simple main memory cache of recently 
accessed web content.
